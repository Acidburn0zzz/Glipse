            <span>That you can configure how many requests your server will remember</span>: To configure how
            many requests your server will hang onto you can simply adjust config as follows (note 15 is the
            default amount that we keep):
            <pre style="margin-top:1em;">
&lt;glimpse enabled="true" requestLimit="5" /&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3> 
    <ol class="plain">
        <li>
            <div>What happens when the maximum number of stored requests is reached (by default 15)?</div>
            Internally we store the requests in a FIFO Queue. This means that when the maximum number spaces in the 
            queue are filled, we take the first one that was entered and remove it from the queue, thus making room 
            for the new request.
