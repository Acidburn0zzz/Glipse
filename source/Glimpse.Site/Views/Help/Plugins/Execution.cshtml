<h2>Execution Tab</h2>

<div class="plugin-summary">
    <p>The Execution tab shows the execution pipeline that was run to build the current page. The items one 
    would typically see in this list are Actions, Filters and ActionResults. Its important to note that Child 
    actions are also shown in this context.</p>

<div class="plugin-layout">
    <h3>Layout</h3> 
    <img src="@Links.Content.Plugin.Execution_jpg" alt="Execution tab example" />
    <ol class="plain">
        <li><span>Key</span>: Indicates which grouping the listed execution details belong to</li>
        <li><span>Value</span>: The breakdown for the given key. Some values require additional explanation:
            <div style="margin-top:0.5em;"><u>ExecutedMethods</u>:</div>
            This shows the methods that make up the execution pipeline for your request. This can be important 
            as many factors can influence the items that make up this pipeline.
            <ul class="plain">
                <li><span>Ordinal</span>: Indicates where in the execution pipeline this method occurred</li>
                <li><span>Child</span>: Whether this method was executed in the context of a child request</li>
                <li><span>Category</span>: The Category/type of the filter. Valid values include: Authorization, Action, Response, Exception</li>
                <li><span>Type</span>: Type that the executed method belongs to</li>
                <li><span>Method</span>: The name of the method executed</li>
                <li><span>Time Elapsed</span>: The amount of time it took to execute the method</li>
                <li><span>Order</span>: The order that has been defined that a filter should be executed</li>
                <li><span>Scope</span>: Scope is a third level sorting mechanism used by ASP.NET MVC to process filters in order. Scopes are executed in the following order: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>First</li>
                        <li>Global</li>
                        <li>Controller</li>
                        <li>Action</li>
                        <li>Last</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><span>Details</span>: Additional properties that may help to identify the instance of the given type</li>
            </ul>

            <div><u>UnExecutedMethods</u>:</div>
            This shows the methods that didn't run in the execution pipeline. This can be used to help you identify 
            filters that you might have expected to run but didn't.

                <li><i>Details are the same as the above</i></li>

        <li>
            <span>Understanding filter execution order can be difficult</span>: There is a complex series of rules to determine filter execution order,
            and these rules have changed between versions of MVC. Glimpse will always show you the actual order of execution, but if you want a deeper understanding you can read the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg416513%28v=VS.98%29.aspx">MSDN filters article</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>That keeping an eye on your Time Elapsed can make a big difference</span>: This may be obvious but 
            by showing the Time Elapsed we can give you an indication as to where a given request is spending its time.
