<h2>Request Tab</h2>

<div class="plugin-summary">
    <p>The Request tab shows very basic HTTP request information. Client-side web debuggers (such as FireBug) often show very similar data.</p>

        <li><span>Value</span>: The value for the given property as seen by the server. Collections are rendered as inline tables with appropriate values. Null values are displayed as "--".</li>

            <span>Difference between what the client sent vs. what the server received</span>:
            The difference between client-side web debuggers and Glimpse is that Glimpse shows you what the server received, 
            while other tools show you what the client sent.
            <br /><br />
            Use this tab to understand the values your server is receiving and to identify any changes made to the request. 
            (By middle man servers such as a misbehaving proxy.)

            <div>What is the difference between the Request and Server tabs?</div>
            It is true that there is overlap between the data that the Request and Server tabs. When it comes to this overlap,
            the primary difference between the tabs is that the Server tabs shows the values pre interpretation  
            and the Request tab shows the data post interpretation. Hence if you have any type conversion errors
            or anything similar, the problem may be discovered here.
