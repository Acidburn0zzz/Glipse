    <h3>Did you know</h3> 
    <ul class="plain">
        <li>
            <span>Unused View Engines</span>: Most people don't know that by default, with the advent of MVC3 there are 
            actually 2 View Engines registered by default (WebFormViewEngine and RazorViewEngine). In most cases, 
            site only actively use one of these engines. 
            <br /><br />
            In the example shown, we can see that the RazorViewEngine is extensively being used, whereas WebFormViewEngine isn't be used. 
            Knowing that in our site we only use RazorViewEngine, we can remove the WebFormViewEngine. 
            <br /><br />
            Once done we are actively reducing the number of lookups that are being performed. Here is how you would remove unused view engines:<br /><br />
            <pre>
public class Global : HttpApplication
{
    public void Application_Start()
    {
        // Clears all previously registered view engines.
        ViewEngines.Engines.Clear();

        // Registers our Razor C# specific view engine.
        // This can also be registered using dependency injection through the new IDependencyResolver interface.
        ViewEngines.Engines.Add(new RazorCSharpViewEngine());
    }
}</pre>

        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Different types of data passed to the view</span>: As of ASP.NET MVC3 there are 3 different ways, ViewData, 
            TempData and Model. Glimpse shows you the data that is passed to all three of these so that you can compare 
            the data being passed in vs. the data being rendered. 
            <br /><br />
            If you are using DisplayFor/EdititorFor, this information can also used in conjunction this the Metadata tab 
            to determine why data on a page may not be rendering as exspected.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3> 
    <ol class="plain">
        <li>
            <div>What are the rows highlighted in yellow and why am I seeing more than one?</div>
            These rows show you successful matches that a View Engine has made. Depending on your scenario you may have many 
            matches as the View Engines may be searched not only to resolve the core view, but also any Partial Views that 
            the page (or Layout / Master Page reference) and/or any DisplayFor/EdititorFor. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Why are you showing me non matches (i.e. rows that aren't yellow)?</div>
            As this tab is trying to show you how MVC is searching View Egines within your site, its important to show 
            the non matches that are made. This helps you make decisions as to whether any optimizations can be made in 
            this area (i.e. removing unused View Engines) or where something is not behaving as exspected.

            <div>I don't want all of my View Model's properties to be serialized, how to I suppress properties being serialized?</div>
            You may want to do this for any number of reasons. For instance, if you are sending your data models to the view and your 
            data models lazy load propoerties (as your can do with Entity Frameowrk or other like frameworks), Glimpse will trigger these 
            properties to load.
