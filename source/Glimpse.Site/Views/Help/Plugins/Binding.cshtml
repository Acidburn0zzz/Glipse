    <strong>Scenario:</strong> In this case we have attempted to submit a login form which has failed to authenticate. Despite this we 
    can still see how the DefaultModelBinder has pulled out the data from the Post and URL and mapped them to our model.<br /><br />

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3> 
    <ol class="plain">
        <li>
            <div>What do the highlighted rows signify?</div>
            They represent matches that the model binder was able to successful make with the help of an associated model binder.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>What do some rows appear greyed out?</div>
            In the same way the successful matches with highlighted rows, unsuccessful matches are greyed out.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Why does my main model (in the screen shot above the first row) not show any matches?</div>
            As the model in this case is a complex object, no one value in the data sent by the client mapped directly to the model. 
            But the through convention and other methods the model binder is able to understand that it is dealing with a complex 
            object and drill down on the properties (as seen in the above screen shot).
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>What is the difference between Attempted Value and Raw Value?</div>
            Attempted Value is the value that the binder will attempt to use after type conversions, etc. Raw value 
            is the value prior to this occurring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Why can't I see my bindings after I successfully full out a form?</div>
            As Glimpse shows you the data associated with the last request (whether that be a Post or Get) this can occur 
            in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get">Post/Redirect/Get</a> scenarios - As the binding 
            Information is associated  with the original Post but the then the following Get is what Glimpse will show.
            In the near future (hopefully release 0.84-0.85 timeframe) we will make this experience better. In the mean time 
            you can use the Remote tab to pull out the original Post request.
